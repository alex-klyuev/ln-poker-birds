/* GENERAL NOTES---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is made so that you can play with cents, which is a feature I want available in the end product.
For that reason, player inputs are converted to cents by multiplying everything by 100, and then divided by
100 before logging back to the console. Open to changes on this front.                                    */

- why are the the blinds reduced by 1cent??


NOTES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simplify all notes before github

Something to think about for live game: how do we deal with bet increments. Let them do whatever they want?
Seems cleaner if there's a minimum chip increment but on the flip side not everything necessarily divides by
the small blind in real games. So for now I'm leaving it as is, with small blind being minimum chip size and big
blind being a multiple of it, but this is subject to change.

Something that would be nice for this game is telling the player WHY their input is invalid. However, since the
ultimate goal here is to make this a front-end app, we'll leave that for later.


BETTING RULES: "In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise
up to all of the chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet).
The minimum raise is equal to the size of the previous bet or raise.
If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise.
For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14."

DONT FORGET THIS PART: "If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos),
the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other players also still in the game).
In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call)."

These are "all-in" scenarios that will need to be handled.

Further edge-cases: maybe some weird things happen if the buy-in is not a multiple of the small blind, but I haven't seen any places
where that would be an issue yet.

Edge case 1: scenario where the initial (previous?) raiser can now no longer re-raise unless someone else raises.
This is such an edge case that I will probably leave it out of this program, but it will be needed for the full game.

Edge case 2: P1 raises 500. P2 raises all-in for 700. The PG.minRaise is is still 500. P1 is not allowed to re-raise
unless another player re-raises (that's what the above comment references). But now, if P3 wants to re-raise, is the
minimum 1000 or 1200? Assuming 1200 for now.
